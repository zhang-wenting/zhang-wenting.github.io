I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the [Department of Economics at Kobe University](http://www.econ.kobe-u.ac.jp/), supervised by [Professor Shigeyuki Hamori](http://www2.kobe-u.ac.jp/~hamori/). The main direction of my research is the time series analysis of financial market crises. I specialize in using econometric models such as ARMA-GARCH models, DCC-GARCH models, TVP-VAR models, Data mining techniques, and machine learning models such as XGboost, Random Forest. As of 2023, I have published five papers in major SSCI and SCIE journals and authored one book. One of my first-author papers is listed as [highly cited paper over 180 times](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1057521921000454) by Google Scholar.
