I am a Project Assistant Professor at the Institute of Statistical Mathematics. I got a PhD. at the [Department of Economics at Kobe University](http://www.econ.kobe-u.ac.jp/), supervised by [Professor Shigeyuki Hamori](http://www2.kobe-u.ac.jp/~hamori/). The main direction of my research is the time series analysis of financial market crises.
